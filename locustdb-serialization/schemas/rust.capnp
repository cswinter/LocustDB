# Rename something in the generated code. The value that you specify in this
# annotation should follow capnp capitalization conventions. So, for example,
# a struct should use CamelCase capitalization like `StructFoo`, even though
# that will get translated to a `struct_foo` module in the generated Rust code.
#
# TODO: support annotating more kinds of things with this.

annotation parentModule @0xabee386cd1450364 (file) :Text;
# A Rust module path indicating where the generated code will be included.
# For example, if this is set to "foo::bar" and the schema file is named
# "baz.capnp", then you could include the generated code like this:
#
#  pub mod foo {
#    pub mod bar {
#      pub mod baz_capnp {
#        include!(concat!(env!("OUT_DIR"), "/baz_capnp.rs"));
#      }
#    }
#  }
